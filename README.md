# CodingBat-Python
**A collection of my solutions to Python problems posted on the CodingBat.com code practice website.**

_What is CodingBat?_

> "**About CodingBat**  
> CodingBat is a free site of live coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python (example problem). CodingBat is a project by Nick Parlante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford."

  
The folder structure of this repo reflects the way that CodingBat's sections are structured.

  
Upon request, I can provide a URL for my _CodingBat_ "Done Page", which lists all the problems I solved, when I solved them, and how how many attempts it took to do each. (And I earned a "10 Star Python Code Badge" - whoopee!). I am not listing the URL here because it includes one of my email addresses, which I'd like to keep (semi-)private.
